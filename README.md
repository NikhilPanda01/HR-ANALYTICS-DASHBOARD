# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD
Interactive HR Analytics Dashboard Using PoweBI


Hello Everyone,

Sharing my 1st report utilizing Power BI for improving employee performance and retention through the HR analytics dashboard ðŸ“Š

Data Source:
The raw data for this project was obtained as a CSV file with 41 columns and approximately 1.5k rows.

Data Cleaning and Processing:
Several steps were taken to prepare the data for analysis, including removing null and duplicate values, correcting spelling errors, and assigning appropriate data types.
A conditional column was added for attrition count, and a new measure was created to calculate the attrition rate.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
To start the analysis, I have identified the following KPIs to track and monitor employee performance and attrition with card visualizations in Power BI:
-> Overall Employee
-> Attrition 
-> Attrition rate
-> Active Employees
-> Average Age

Charts and Insights:
I have used several charts and visualizations to gain insights into the employee data, such as:

-> Pie Chart:  Illustrates the attrition rates of R&D, sales, and HR departments, emphasizing the proportion of attrition in each department.

-> Frequency Chart: The chart displays the number of employees divided into age groups, with separate figures for males and females.

-> Heat Map: Illustrates job satisfaction ratings across various job roles within a company, presenting a visual representation of the satisfaction levels in different positions.

-> Bar Chart: Presents a visual representation of attrition rates according to education levels, allowing for easy comparison of attrition between educational backgrounds.

-> Donut chart: This chart displays the attrition rate between genders for different age groups within the company, offering a graphical representation of attrition patterns based on both gender and age.

->Slicer/Filters Used: The dynamic dashboard utilizes slicers/filters, which enable users to customize the displayed data based on specific educational fields, thus facilitating interactive exploration and analysis centered around particular educational backgrounds
